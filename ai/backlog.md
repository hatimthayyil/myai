## Memory

- `ai chat`, stage 1 done (store, tree, view, compactor library, `ai memory nap`); stage 2 next. Spec: `ai/research/20261004T194110---ai-chat.md`.
- Multi-machine sync for the chat memory (rebase-style merge: pushed messages never move), deferred.
- Repo-level memory, alongside the user memory. Deferred. Decided (2026-10-04):
  - Purpose: portable with the repo, shared with collaborators, focus at wake. Inside a repo, repo memory has priority; user memory stays reachable.
  - Routing: every note goes to user memory. Notes that are repo-local and not personal also go to the repo memory, as the same record (same key).
  - Wake: both covers in one `WAKE_LINES` budget, repo first.
  - Sharing: one ref per person (`refs/ai/memory/<person>`) on the project remote; teammates' refs readable.
  - Open: who decides the repo copy (agent `note --repo` vs classifier, below); budget split; how teammates' refs appear (wake, grep/zoom, or not yet); creation and push policy; `<person>` identity; scope prefixes on ids (`u#`, `r#`).
- Classifier ("Jev type model") to pick the notes that also go to repo memory: repo-local and not personal. Deferred until repo memory exists.
